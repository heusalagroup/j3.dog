                <h1 id="introducing-j3dog-the-secure-scalable-3d-object-database">Introducing j3dog: The Secure, Scalable 3D Object Database<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-j3dog-the-secure-scalable-3d-object-database" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The j3dog database is a secure, scalable data storage solution designed to
provide fast and reliable access to large amounts of data. With a focus on
security, performance, and scalability, the j3dog database is well-suited for a
wide range of applications and use cases.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features<a class="headerlink" href="#key-features" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Secure: The j3dog database is designed to protect sensitive and confidential
  data, with the ability to run on-premises and on private networks.</li>
<li>Scalable: The j3dog database is able to handle high volumes of data and
  traffic and is scalable to meet the needs of its users.</li>
<li>Fast and reliable: The j3dog database is optimized for fast read operations
  and efficient data modification, making it well-suited for a wide range of
  applications.</li>
<li>Flexible: The j3dog database provides a JSON-based REST API with CRUD access
  to data and the ability to run specific queries on the server side. It also
  has built-in support for creating custom REST APIs, and an spreadsheet app
  that end users can use to manipulate and manage the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-structure">Data Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#data-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The j3dog database stores data in a three dimensional structure, with each cell
of the structure being represented by a JSON array. Different nodes in the
database are layered from different sides, with each cell being saved three
times to three different arrays. Modification to one of these cells will trigger
a change to the three layers it is saved on, but will leave the other layers
unchanged. This allows the j3dog database to be fault tolerant and have a
copy-on-write type of access to most cells in the database.</p>
<h2 id="api-and-integration-points">API and Integration Points<a class="headerlink" href="#api-and-integration-points" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The j3dog database provides a number of API and integration points to allow for
easy integration with other systems and applications. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON-based REST API: The j3dog database provides a REST API with CRUD access
  to data and the ability to run specific queries on the server side. This API
  can be used to programmatically access and manipulate data in the database.</li>
<li>Custom REST APIs: The j3dog database has built-in support for creating custom
  REST APIs, making it easy to integrate with other systems and applications.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet app: The j3dog database includes a simple spreadsheet app that end
  users can use to manipulate and manage data in the database. This app is
  accessible through a web browser and does not require any special software or
  applications to be installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These API and integration points allow the j3dog database to be easily
integrated with a wide range of systems and applications, and make it simple for
users to access and manipulate data in the database.</p>
<h2 id="security-measures">Security Measures<a class="headerlink" href="#security-measures" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The j3dog database is designed with security as a top priority. Measures are in
place to protect sensitive and confidential data, including the ability to run
the database on-premises and on private networks. Additionally, it is possible
to restrict or lessen access to specific parts of the three dimensional grids,
allowing for granular control over who has access to what data.</p>
<p>These measures help to ensure that organizations using the j3dog database are
able to truly own and protect their data, and make the database suitable for use
in a wide range of applications and scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="performance-and-scalability">Performance and Scalability<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-and-scalability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The j3dog database is designed to be fast and reliable, with optimized read
operations and efficient data modification. It is also scalable, able to handle
high volumes of data and traffic to meet the needs of its users.</p>
<p>While the j3dog database is expected to have excellent performance and
scalability, these characteristics have not yet been proven. Further testing and
evaluation will be necessary to determine the full extent of the database's
capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#example-use-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The j3dog database is well-suited for a wide range of applications and use
cases. Some example use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent storage for modern apps: The j3dog database can serve as the
  persistent storage service for a three dimensional spreadsheet application, or
  as a document database for any modern app.</li>
<li>Data storage and analysis: The j3dog database can be used to store and analyze
  large amounts of data, with the ability to run specific queries and manipulate
  data through the API or spreadsheet app.</li>
<li>Data sharing and collaboration: The j3dog database can be used to share and
  collaborate on data with others, with the ability to restrict access to
  specific parts of the database as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the j3dog database can
be used. Its flexibility and versatility make it suitable for a wide range of
applications and scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The j3dog database is a secure, scalable data storage solution designed to
provide fast and reliable access to large amounts of data. With a focus on
security, performance, and scalability, the j3dog database is well-suited for a
wide range of applications and use cases.</p>
